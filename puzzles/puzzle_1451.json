Assuming the coffee has been poured from a pot, I guess.I mean, most people would chuck instant coffee into a cup and add hot water, wouldn’t they? In other words it would always be instant.They wouldn’t make two cups of instant coffee, for example, and have one later, making it less instant, would they? Would they? No, of course not. That would be ridiculous.They’d just stick the kettle on again when they are ready to have another cup. Which would be another cup of instant coffee.To be honest, you could even argue that coffee poured from a pot is instant too, because it’s there ready to pour whenever you want it.I guess what I’m trying to say is that the clue is… hello?Guys? Where’d you all go? Hello…?! Guys???",
