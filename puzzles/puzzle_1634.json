Solution is O (a recognised abbreviation of “old”) followed by ONAGER (a kind of donkey or “ass”) once reversed (indicated by “rejected”), like so: O-REGANO. This is a solution that makes a regular appearance in crosswords because 1) all its odd letters are vowels, and 2) it ends in a useful ‘O’. A lot of the time, cryptic setters also use ONAGER in the construction of their clue, in a similar way they always use LIGNITE and IGNITE, or DISRAELI and ISRAELI. It gets to be a bit repetitive, and you know what they say about familiarity. To be fair, the last time OREGANO appeared (grid 1615 in May, also on odd intersecting letters) the setter at least used a different approach in their clue, using Regan from Shakespeare’sKing Lear.

I was half-joking at the time, but now I’m not so sure. Have I accidentally stumbled upon something? Could we have a cabal of pinko setters, quietly promoting Russia during wartime through the medium of cryptic crosswords? Gasp!
