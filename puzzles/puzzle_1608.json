        "explanation": "DAIMLER(i.e. “car manufacturer”). Solution is D (i.e. “close of Oxford”, i.e. the last letter of “Oxford”) followed by AIMER (i.e. “one intending”) once wrapped around or “importing” L (i.e. “first [letter] of Ladas”), like so: D-AIM(L)ER. There has been some interesting commentary in the main paper over the weekend about the differences between crosswords in US and British newspapers. In my (limited) experience, US crosswords are somewhat more forgiving in what they will allow in their grids: company names especially. It’s perhaps not surprising when you consider the large number of intersecting solutions in US grids, but I do prefer the relative restraint exercised by the Brits. Until this solution, anyway.Kerching!",
