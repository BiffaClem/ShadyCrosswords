To the best of my knowledge, jerk is a weightlifting discipline, while PE is a recognised abbreviation of “physical education”. Call me weird, but any school that puts weightlifting into their PE classes would be up for child cruelty toot sweet. Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe the curriculum has changed and the setter’s kids are all built like brick shithouses…) preceded by or placed “after” DO (i.e. “party”), like so: DO-PE.[EDIT: As has been noted in a few comments, “jerks” appears to be a reference to physical education from aways-back. Chambers also has this definition: “a movement in physical exercises”. Maybe I’m from a much more cynical generation. If any PE teacher at our school asked us all to jerk for him he’d be up in front of the beak sharpish. – LP]",
