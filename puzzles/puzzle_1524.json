Turning this into CONVERSATION isn’t something supported by my assorted dictionaries, so this clue perhaps ought to have had a riddly question mark on the end).[EDIT: Thanks to Chris in the comments for cleaning this one up. I wasn’t reading the clue closely enough. The solution is CONVERSION (i.e. “change”) wrapped “around” AT and followed by CORK (i.e. “stopper”), like so: CONVERS(AT)ION-STOPPER. Cheers, Chris! – LP]",
