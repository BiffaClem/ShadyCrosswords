If one removes DIS (being Detective Inspectors, i.e. “police officers”), you then get RETRIBUTION. Thanks, Mick! – LP]",

I’m guessing the setter then means UR to be “your”, to then make CON-NOIS(S)E-UR, but this usage isn’t supported by any of my assorted reference books. If the intention was a contraction of “you are”, then 1) “you’re” is not the same as “your”, and 2) some kind of homophone indicator should have been used. So are we allowing textspeak now, setters, or am I missing something? Hmm. Given my recent form, the latter is a possibility…[EDIT – After sneaking a look in a few other dictionaries, I see the latest Oxford lists UR as an abbreviation of “your”. Shame, Oxford!
