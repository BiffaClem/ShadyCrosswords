My solution, for what it’s worth, is PHIL-HARMONIC, the latter chunk being an anagram (indicated by “distressed”) of CHOIRMAN. As for PHIL, “vocal” could indicate a homophone, but I’m not twigging much of a link between “line” and “fill”, or whatever the homophone is supposed to be. If a kind soul sheds light on this one, I’ll update the post. Moving on…[EDIT: Thanks to John in the comments, who points out that “line” can be “fill” in terms of lining one’s pockets. Sounds good to me. Cheers, John! – LP]",
