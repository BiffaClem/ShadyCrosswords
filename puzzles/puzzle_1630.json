        "explanation": "BY-AND-BY(i.e. “anon” or in due course. My Chambers suggests this ought to have been unhyphenated, but no biggie). I guess the rest of the clue plays on two meanings of BY, being “book, evidently not anon” – if work is ascribed to someone then it can’t be said to have been done anonymously – and “going around”. I’m not feeling it, though. I’ll update the post if someone enlightens me, otherwise I’m not wasting any more energy here.",

Solution is DW (i.e. “do will initially”, i.e. the first letters of “do” and “will”) followed by an anagram (indicated by “sadly”) of SAVE and R (i.e. “king”, specifically a recognised abbreviation of the LatinRex), like so: D-W-ARVES. Poor quality clue. I mean read it back as an entire sentence. It’s garbage! What on earth is the setter trying to convey here? That a dwarven shindig is going to somehow spare or redeem a king in some way? What does any of that even mean?! And this isn’t the only word salad this week, by the way. Far from it. Read the clue for 1a and tell me it makes a lick of sense.  It’s as if ChatGPT has had a hand in writing some of the clues. Now, I can hear some of you flexing your fingers ready to tell me how I’m being much too harsh on the setter, that I’m being too negative, cheer up it may never happen etc, so I’ll try to rein it in for the rest of this post. But, seriously, this has to have been the poorest quality stinker for some years.",

Turn back two pages in this week’s Saturday Review pullout and you’ll find this solution also appeared in the cryptic Jumbo two weeks ago. This is sadly rather commonplace, and much the inspiration behind the Déjà vu memes. You may have seen a comment from burleypab a couple of months ago regarding the tools of the trade employed by Times setters. If not, to summarise, they essentially use a crossword solver to help them fill their grids, presumably one sanctioned or developed by The Times. While this is somewhat less romantic than a leaky, hand-cranked machine that spins a few cogs and spits out a grid, I would argue that this solver-based approach, used across enough setters, allows their biases to lead them to the same solutions. Presented with a list of potential solutions for their grid, setters will naturally err towards those with intersecting letters that frequently occur in other words. The more “friendly” intersecting letters in the word, the better. However, setters will also be inextricably drawn to any such solutions that can give their grid a bit of pzazz. (This week’s setter, as you’ve seen, rather overdid it.) 90% of the time the solver-based approach is fine, and even when repeats do occur they will often go unnoticed by solvers, but it’s this practice that can see lesser-used words like RAITA or Max ERNST appear again and again, and they stick out like a sore thumb. Could the same accusation be levied toward AMONTILLADO? I’ll leave that up to you to decide, but it almost makes me wish there was an actual GridFill 4000. Meanwhile, have another meme…",
