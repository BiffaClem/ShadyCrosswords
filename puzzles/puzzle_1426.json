        "text": "Rebellion? Show hesitation, deposing leading pair",
        "enumeration": "4",
        "answer": "TEND",
        "explanation": "TEND.This is a complete guess, I’m afraid. The clue seems to suggest the solution is derived by removing or “deposing” the first two letters or “leading pair” of a six-letter word meaning “show hesitation” which fits the letters **T*N*. The best I’ve got at the moment is EXTEND, but I can’t square TEND with “rebellion”. Also, if the solution was TEND then its proximity to the similar-sounding TENDER IS THE NIGHT would suggest poor grid construction from the setter. So, yeah, this is very likely incorrect. If some kind soul swings by with the proper solution then I’ll update the post, but for now I’m going to get on with my weekend.[EDIT: The solution to this one was TINY, as suggested by a number of commenters. That would be MUTINY (i.e. “rebellion”) with the “leading pair” of letters “deposed”. I’m still none the wiser why this would be “show hesitation”, though. – LP][FURTHER EDIT: A big thank you to Sue and Steve in the comments for clearing this one up. It seems the clue was incorrect and should have been:“Small-scale rebellion, deposing leading pair (4)”. This then gives you MUTINY, from which you then remove the “leading pair” of letters, MU, to leave TINY, i.e. “small-scale” – LP]",
