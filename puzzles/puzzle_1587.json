Solution is OUTDOOR (i.e. “at regatta, perhaps” – other outdoor sporting events are available) with the last couple of letters removed (indicated by “almost”). Another minor gripe of mine is when trim indicators are used to remove multiple end-letters. It’s legitimate, granted, but can make it harder to work forwards from a clue than it would be working backwards from a possible solution.",
