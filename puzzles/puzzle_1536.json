I was expecting him to have been some mega-famous racehorse during the 1950s or something, known today solely to the types of wrinkly old men who have every edition of Racing Post ever printed. Apparently Stradivarius won the Goodwood Cup a record four years in a row in 2020 and the Ascot Gold Cup a bunch of times. Is that enough to immortalise him? Will non-horsey types come to The Times Jumbo Cryptic Crossword Book 25 in the years to come and immediately think “ah, yes, good old Stradivarius. Bloody good horse, that…”? Hmm. We’ll see). Solution is an anagram (indicated by “to play”) of CARE followed by a homophone (indicated by “what sounds like”) of HOARSE (i.e. “harsh”), like so: RACE-HORSE.",
