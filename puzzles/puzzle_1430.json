I’m wondering if it’s also referring to skate fish, which usually swim in warm waters, so an ICE SKATE could be said to be lost. I can’t readily find a reference linking skates to slippers, so I could be overthinking it.[EDIT: Thanks to Andrew in the comments for offering a clearer explanation. “Lost” can also be an anagram indicator, which would then make “slipper” an ice skate, in that an ice skate lets you slip and slide about an ice rink. “Fitting” indicates the C of Cinderella is slotted into the anagram of EEK IT’S A, like so: I(C)ESKATE.
