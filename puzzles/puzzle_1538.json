Consider all the things you can find on a lawn, including Jumbo droppings. That’s quite a list to whittle down, isn’t it? When the setter significantly broadens the parameters of operative words or phrases like this, it doesn’t really increase the difficulty of the clue so much as hold up the solver. It’s stuff like this that detracts from a satisfying solve, especially when overused). Solution is WE’D (a contraction of “we had”) reversed (indicated by “to go round”) and followed by DROP (i.e. “casually put”), like so: D’EW-DROP.",
