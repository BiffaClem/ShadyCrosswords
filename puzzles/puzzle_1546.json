Creators Polyphony Digital made damn sure they secured decent review scores on Metacritic (average 8.7/10) before issuing that update. Because reviewers might not have looked so kindly upon the game had they known it was really going to be a grindathon. Comically, the excuse Polyphony Digital gave for changing the game’s economy was so players would feel a greater sense of achievement and value in the cars they unlock – which would be fine were it not for those ever-present microtransactions patiently awaiting your credit card. “Cynical” barely covers it, as the somewhat less favourableuserreviews on Metacritic can testify (average 2.5/10). Modern gaming, folks… Honestly, you’re better off picking up a book), like so: G(ETA)T.",
