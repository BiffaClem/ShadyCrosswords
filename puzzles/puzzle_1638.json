        "explanation": "THROW ONE’S HAT IN THE RING(i.e. “issue a challenge”). A quick aside: thanks in part to restrictions placed on the amount of gambling advertising on UK TV, there are so few advertisers across Sky Sports these days that Sky often have to fill most or all of their ad breaks with show trailers or ads for their own umpteen spurious services. Meanwhile, those few adverts that aren’t for Sky are created by agencies who rarely create more than one TV ad per campaign. As a result, pretty much every ad break across Sky Sports comprises a vanishingly small pool of adverts on heavy rotation. TV types don’t seem to appreciate that when viewers are plagued with the same shit over and over and over again, they grow averse to the stuff being advertised. If I cease posting soon, it might be because I’ve stolen all the conservatory insulation, Sky “smart tech” (please…) and knob drugs I can get my hands on and burnt them all in a big pit. Sirram’s comment last week about me posting from prison may be strangely prophetic.",
