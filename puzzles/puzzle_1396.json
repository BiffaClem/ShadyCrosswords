It’s a recognised abbreviation of Order of Merit, perhaps, but that’s more a title than a name. Maybe the setter is playing fast and loose here, which wouldn’t be an isolated case. Ah, sod it, I’m moving on.[EDIT: A big thank you to Tommy in the comments for clarifying this one. Publicity is PROMO, not PR as I had it.
