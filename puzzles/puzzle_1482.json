I guess the solution was supposed to be AS (i.e. “when”) “reversed” and wrapped “around” CAP, then followed by FLOW (i.e. “move steadily”), like so: S(CAP)A-FLOW. Trouble is CAP is not a headland. CAPE, yes; CAP, no. None of my go-to reference books support this one (Chambers; Oxford; Collins Concise; Bradford’s). Looks like an “endlessly” indicator has been missed, but I’m happy to be corrected.On a different tack, I learned something new from this one: that the word “scarper” was in part derived from the solution, being the Cockney rhyming slang for “go”.",

Trouble is, “king’s” is singular, being a contraction of “king is”. Had the clue finished “…kings visit county” then all would be good. Either that or the setter forgot there are two Rs in YORKSHIRE.
